                <strong>System of a Down</strong> is an Armerian-American metal band formed by musicians of Armenian origin: vocalist Serj Tankian,
                guitarist <strong>Daron Malakian</strong>, bassist <strong>Odadjian</strong>, and drummer <strong>Dolmayan</strong> in the mid-1990s. They have released five
                studio albums, nineteen singles (including promotional releases), and thirteen music videos. By the end of 1997, the
                group had signed to American Recordings, then distributed as Columbia Records. The following year, they released their
                eponymous debut album, which peaked at number 124 on the United States' Billboard 200 and number 103 on the United
                Kingdom's UK Albums Chart;[1][2] it was later certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America
                (RIAA) and gold by Canadian Recording Industry Association (CRIA). Their eponymous debut album produced a single for the
                song "Sugar", which reached the top 30 on the Billboard mainstream rock songs and alternative songs charts. Their
                follow-up album, Toxicity (2001), topped the US and Canadian charts, and also reached the top 10 in Australia, Finland,
                and New Zealand. The album was certified triple platinum in its home country, and triple platinum in Australia by the
                Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), as well as double platinum by Music Canada. Toxicity produced singles
                for the title track, "Chop Suey!", and "Aerials". The last of these peaked at number one on the Billboard Mainstream
                Rock Songs and Alternative Songs charts.

                Steal This Album! (2002) failed to repeat the same success as its predecessor, reaching the top 20 in only the US and
                Australia. Three years later, the group produced a double album, with the two sections released six months apart. The
                first, entitled Mezmerize, was released in early 2005; it peaked at number one in nine countries, and certified triple
                platinum in Canada, platinum in the US and Australia. This album's first single, "B.Y.O.B.", peaked at No. 27 on the
                Billboard Hot 100 and No. 26 on the UK Singles Chart.[1][2] The follow-up, "Question!", reached the top 40 in the United
                Kingdom and Ireland. Later that year, the group released the second part, Hypnotize. Like its predecessor, the album
                peaked at number one in the US, Canadian, Finnish, and New Zealand charts. System of a Down is the first band since The
                Beatles to release two chart-topping albums in the US in the same year.[3] Hypnotize was certified platinum in US, and
                gold in Australia, Germany, and Switzerland. It produced two singles, the title track and "Lonely Day", which reached
                No. 4 and No. 16 on the Finnish chart, respectively. In 2006, the group went on a hiatus, and since then, all members
                had begun work on side projects.[4] A reunion was announced on November 29, 2010.[5] On November 5, 2020, System of a
                Down released their first songs in 15 years, "Protect the Land" and "Genocidal Humanoidz". Both songs also received a
                music video and marked the band's first single in 14 years, since "Lonely Day".
